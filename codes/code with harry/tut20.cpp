// Just Discussed about OOP and POP
// Object Oriented Programming and Procedual Oriented Programming.
// Why is OOP useful.
// Classes - Basic Template for creating objects
// Objects - Basic run time entities.
// Polymorphism  - ability to take more than one forms. (eg. Function Overflow)
// Message Passing - Object.message(information)
// Data Abstraction and Encapsulation - Wrapping data and fucntions into one unit.
// Inheritance - Properties of one class can be inherited into others.
// Dynamic Binding - code which will execute is not known until the program runs.
